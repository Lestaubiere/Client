In case of extraordinary external circumstances, we can invoke force majeure and the deposit will therefore expire. In case of cancellation less than 6 weeks before arrival, the (down) payment will not be refunded. To avoid this leading to financial damage, it is recommended to take out cancellation insurance with an insurance company of your choice."
